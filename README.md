To use an Autohotkey script...

  1. download the script and [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
  1. use AHK to open the script (if it's name ends in `.ahk` you should be able to double-click on it in Finder)
  1. Open the script in a text editor to see what the options are
      * If a clause begins with `F8::` that means it activates when you press `F8`
      
Note: AHK is an absolute dumpster fire of a piece of software.
